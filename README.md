# JustList - Smart, Simple Shopping Lists

JustList was originally created as part of a University assignment. 

It's aim is to provide a UX as simple as a notes app while including additional time-saving and usability functionality.

## Motivation

As mentioned, JustList was born out of a University project, specifically for a Mobile Development module. As a developer it was my second app-based project and first experience developing with Flutter and Dart. Since the submission of this University project I have continued to develop the app out of personal interest and to futher my experience with Flutter.

My intention is to continue development to the point of having all initial and potentially some additional features implemented. The app should be at the point that it is usable by any member of it's target audience, in other words, it should be production ready. The decision will be made later on whether to actually take the app public or not.

## Feature Set

JustList's principal 'claim-to-fame' is it's self-refreshing feature. The user is given the ability to add a 'timeout' to any item they create which is how often, in days, they usually buy the item. Whenever a new list is created the items that have *timed out* are automatically added to the list. In this sense the lists are *disposable* and a new list should be created for each shopping trip.

The app also features a *favourites* list containing all the items that have a user-set *timeout* along with other commonly bought items that the user can save for easy retrieval. 

The main interface is a simple list of items contained within tiles that can be highlighted when the user has bought or picked up the item. The tiles can also be dismissed if the user no longer requires them or if they were added automatically but the user does not need them at that time. By default, items that have not been highlighted (read bought) in the current list will be carried over when a new list is created. When a settings page is added this feature will be made toggleable.

The ability to create and maintain multiple lists has been started on, however the implemetation is currently incomplete. This is an initial feature and will therefore be completed as soon as possible.

## Planned Functionality

This list will be added to.
